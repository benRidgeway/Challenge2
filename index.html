                <p>
                    My full name is Forrest Benjamin Ridgeway. Sometimes I feel like 8 syllables is a lot for a name. I was born in Columbia, South Carolina. When I was 5 we moved to Concord, North Carolina, where I would bounce around until I finally make to the town I'm in now, which is Harrisburg, NC.</br> 
                    My free time is spent looking at/for, and taking care of plants. I have an app that allows me to take pictures and it will let me know what plant it is, so needless to say my neighbors can always find me wandering the front yard with my phone pointed at the ground. 
                    I also like to play video games. The way life is going I have had a lot less time to play, but at one point I had the chance to enter the professional E-Sports scene, but fell just short, being in the top 1% of players in the world in &copy;Rocket League while I needed to be in the top 500 players to qualify.</br>
                    When I'm not playing games, hanging out with my wife, or taking pictures of plants you will always find me on the computer, furiously typing as I try to navigate the brick wall of a learning curve that coding seems to have.

                  In this project I helped optimize the existing code. There were repititions and non-descriptive code that I cleaned up and made clearer for the next coder.

                    In this project I helped a start up business called &copy;Run-Buddy. They tasked me with creating a website for them to use that allows the user to fill out forms, choose trainers, learn about the curriculum, and how to contact the business. I was introduced to HTML and CSS in this project.
